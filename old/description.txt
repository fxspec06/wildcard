thanks to all who continue to work on enyojs

cribbage board is a simple app i've made in the last week

a few coding sessions, a clean windows install, and ~50hrs later i've got a complete app

cribbage board+ uses enyojs beta 5, with panels

it doesn't load anything funny and shouldn't do anything out of the ordinary.

html5 local storage is used for saved game and stats

all images were made by me or found available for modification and commercial redistribution

thank you for taking the time to review this app, and I hope to see it in the catalog soon!

Sincerely,
Bryan Leasot
